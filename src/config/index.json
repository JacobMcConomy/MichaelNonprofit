        "description": "It started with a single piece of trash I stepped over one day, something small and forgettable, like a crumpled bottle on the side of the road. But for some reason, I didn’t forget it. I kept thinking about how many people must have walked by it, thinking the same thing I did: “Someone else will pick it up.” That moment planted a seed in my mind. I began noticing how normal litter had become, how we had grown numb to the sight of waste around us, like it was just another part of the landscape. That quiet realization eventually grew into action. Trash Free Tomorrow was born not out of perfection, but out of a need for responsibility. I didn’t start with funding or a big platform, just a vision: that we could build a future where environmental care isn’t rare, but routine. Where cleanup is more than a weekend event it’s a cultural shift. This nonprofit is my way of turning frustration into something tangible. It’s for the people who care, but don’t always know where to start. It’s for the communities that deserve better. And most of all, it’s for the generations that will inherit whatever world we leave behind.",
